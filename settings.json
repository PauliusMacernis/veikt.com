However, let's keep in mind that huge organizations and/or huge projects exists and so then the main domain is sometimes being divided into smaller parts - subdomains or local TLDs. For example, this could be named as the big project - https://www.indeed.com/, and smaller parts of it - http://ca.indeed.com/ , https://de.indeed.com/ , http://www.indeed.jobs/ , ... At such case we would use smaller. However, in the particular case of indeed, https://www.indeed.com/ means the project of US and so we will not find the subdomain like that: https://us.indeed.com/ . That's why in the case of indeed https://www.indeed.com/ is ok to be used. The main point here is - research a little on the project before picking the URL.",

Think about it like that - the content of this file should be exactly the same after grabbing the content again. If the content of this file is changed then it means that the job posting is changed too. The content of the file is not meant to be valid HTML, XML or other. However, you have to think in front - you prepare the data for extracting. Which means we will want to extract the specific data out of this file later, for example: City, Salary, Company name, Company e-mail, etc. If you see that adding some extra tags would make sense and so the job for the content extractor will be easier then go for it!",
